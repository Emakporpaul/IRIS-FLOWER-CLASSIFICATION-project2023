# Iris Flower Classification with Machine Learning

This project is a comprehensive application of machine learning using Python programming. Its primary focus is on the classification of Iris flowers using various machine learning algorithms implemented with the Scikit-learn library. 

## Algorithms Utilized

In this project, we harness the power of different machine learning algorithms, including both supervised and unsupervised learning techniques, to predict and achieve accuracy in Iris flower classification. The key algorithms employed are:

- Decision Tree Classifier
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classifier
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Logistic Regression
- Metrics for evaluating model performance
- Train-test splitting for dataset preparation

## About the Iris Dataset

We base our analysis and predictions on the famous Iris dataset. This dataset is ideal for machine learning beginners due to its simplicity and clarity.
